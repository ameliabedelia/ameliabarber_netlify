The number of seasons a rider has been professional is a much better predictor of UCI ranking than age in female professional cycling and the 6th season as a professional is when the most riders have their best ranking.\nIn part 1 of my data sciencing of women’s professional cycling, I focused on the demographics of the women’s peloton (how the number of riders has changed over time, where the
