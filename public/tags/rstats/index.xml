      <description>What is the relationship between bird phylogeny and popularity? The Tidy Tuesday dataset this week is on New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Bird of the Year 2019&amp;rdquo; so I thought it might be fun to look at how the phylogeny of the birds of NZ correlates with their popularity. Are the most popular birds closely related to each other? Or are popular birds scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree of birds in the competition?</description>

      <description>Tidy Tuesday time, y’all It’s been months since I did a Tidy Tuesday, so I set aside an hour and said I had to post SOMETHING at the end of it. This week’s dataset was on Simpsons guest stars over the 30 (!!!) years the show has been on the air. Though I was initially tempted to do something looking at the most “famous” guest stars that have been on the show or the connectivity of the cast and guest stars in other projects outside of the show, both of those require additional data and more time than I had, so I went with the next thing that popped into my head, which was simply mapping the most common guest stars and their number of apperances in each season.</description>

      <description>tl;dr The number of seasons a rider has been professional is a much better predictor of UCI ranking than age in female professional cycling and the 6th season as a professional is when the most riders have their best ranking.
In part 1 of my data sciencing of women’s professional cycling, I focused on the demographics of the women’s peloton (how the number of riders has changed over time, where the riders are from, how many seasons they stay).</description>

I am passionate about women’s cycling, so I thought what better way to christen this blog with a post combining my love of women’s cycling and data science. Women’s cycling is every bit as competitive and entertaining as men’s cycling, yet these athletes continue to struggle for equality and recognition in a male-dominated sport.</description>
