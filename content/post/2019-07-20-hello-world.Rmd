# Hello world (wide web)!

Welcome to my personal website created in R using the [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill. Additional thanks to [Huabing Zhao](https://github.com/zhaohuabing) for the ["Clean White" theme](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite) and [Cedric Scherer](https://cedricscherer.netlify.com) for the inspiration and helpful github repo :)
