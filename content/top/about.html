<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img src="/top/about_files/hello-world.jpeg" alt="me" /><br />
I am currently a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html">Leibniz Institute of Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans Knöll Institute</a> in Jena, Germany and the <a href="https://www.hygiene.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite/">Institute for Hygiene and Microbiology at the University of Würzburg</a> studying fungal biology and comparitive genomics of <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida</em> spp, with a special focus on antifungal resistance.<br></p>
<p>Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Utah in the group of <a href="https://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/mulvey.php">Matthew Mulvey</a> studying how the vast genetic diversity seen in <em>Escherichia coli</em> strains translates to differences in disease progression and host response during sepsis using a novel zebrafish model of disease we developed.<br></p>
<p>You can find my full CV <a href="https://ameliabarber.netlify.com/top/vitae/">here</a><br></p>
<p>When not in the lab, you can most likely find me out riding a bike, hiking, hanging out with my husband and furchild in charge,or participating in the weekly R4DS <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> data science and visualization challenges. <br><br><br></p>
