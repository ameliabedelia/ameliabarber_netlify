<h2>About Me</h2>
<p><img src="/top/about_files/hello-world.jpeg" alt="me" /><br />
</p>
<p>I am a <a href="https://barber-lab.com">junior research group leader</a> at the <a href="https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html">Leibniz Institute of Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans Kn√∂ll Institute</a> in Jena, Germany. We study how ecological interactions shape human pathogenicity in humans using experimental and computational approaches. Our group is incubated within the Systems Biology &amp; Bioinformatics group led by <a href="https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/systembiologie-und-bioinformatik.html">Gianni Panagiotou</a> and is financially supported by the <a href="https://www.microverse-cluster.de/en/">Balance of the Microverse Excellence Cluster</a>.</p>
<p>I also did my postdoctoral work at the Leibiz-HKI, studying fungal biology, antifungal resistance, and comparative and population genomics of <em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Candida</em> spp.<br></p>
<p>Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Utah in the group of <a href="https://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/mulvey.php">Matthew Mulvey</a> studying how the vast genetic diversity seen in <em>Escherichia coli</em> strains translates to differences in disease progression and host response during sepsis using a novel zebrafish model of disease we developed.<br></p>

<p>When not in the lab, you can most likely find me out riding a bike or hiking.
