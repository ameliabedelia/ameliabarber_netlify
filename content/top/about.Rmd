## About Me
![me](/top/about_files/hello-world.jpeg)\

I am a [junior research group leader](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/fungal-informatics.html) at the [Leibniz Institute of Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans Kn√∂ll Institute](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html) in Jena, Germany. We study how ecological interactions shape human pathogenicity in humans using experimental and computational approaches. Our group is incubated within the Systems Biology & Bioinformatics group led by [Gianni Panagiotou](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/systembiologie-und-bioinformatik.html) and is financially supported by the [Balance of the Microverse Excellence Cluster](https://www.microverse-cluster.de/en/). 

I also did my postdoctoral work at the Leibiz-HKI, studying fungal biology, antifungal resistance, and comparative and population genomics of *Aspergillus* and *Candida* spp.<br>

Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Utah in the group of [Matthew Mulvey](https://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/mulvey.php) studying how the vast genetic diversity seen in *Escherichia coli* strains translates to differences in disease progression and host response during sepsis using a novel zebrafish model of disease we developed.<br>

When not in the lab, you can most likely find me out riding a bike or hiking.
