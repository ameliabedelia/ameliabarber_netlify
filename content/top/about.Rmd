## About Me
![me](/top/about_files/hello-world.jpeg)\

I am currently a postdoc at the [Leibniz Institute of Natural Product Research and Infection Biology - Hans Knöll Institute](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html) in Jena, Germany and the [Institute for Hygiene and Microbiology at the University of Würzburg](https://www.hygiene.uni-wuerzburg.de/startseite/) studying fungal biology and comparitive genomics of *Aspergillus* and *Candida* spp, with a special focus on antifungal resistance.<br>

Prior to that, I was a PhD student at the University of Utah in the group of [Matthew Mulvey](https://www.bioscience.utah.edu/faculty/mulvey/mulvey.php) studying how the vast genetic diversity seen in *Escherichia coli* strains translates to differences in disease progression and host response during sepsis using a novel zebrafish model of disease we developed.<br>

You can find my full CV [here](https://ameliabarber.netlify.com/top/vitae/)<br>

When not in the lab, you can most likely find me out riding a bike, hiking, or geeking out on data science and visualization.
